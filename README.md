# OrbitPay POV Provisioner

This repository contains a **self-service Terraform template** designed to provision isolated **OrbitPay POV environments** on demand.

It creates a fully functional PagerDuty configuration for the OrbitPay simulated enterprise, including Teams, Services, Dependencies, and Event Orchestration.

## ✨ Features

*   **Zero Config:** Just bring your API Token. Schedules and Users are auto-configured.
*   **Region Support:** Works seamlessly with both **US** and **EU** PagerDuty service regions.
*   **Isolated Sandboxes:** Uses Terraform Workspaces (e.g., `pov-acme`) so you can run multiple POVs in the same account without collisions.
*   **Full Architecture:** Deploys the standard OrbitPay 4-Team model (Payments, Wallet, CX, Infra) with L1-L3 service dependencies.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) (v1.3+)
*   PagerDuty **User API Token** (Account Settings -> API Access)

### Provision a POV

1.  Run the provisioner script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/quickstart.sh
    ```

2.  Follow the prompts:
    *   **Token:** Paste your PagerDuty API Token.
    *   **Email:** Enter your email (you will be placed on-call).
    *   **Customer Name:** Enter the prospect's name (e.g., "Acme").

3.  **Done!** The script will create a workspace (e.g., `pov-acme`) and deploy the resources.

## 🏗 What Gets Built?

**Teams:**
*   Payments Platform (PP)
*   Wallet & Ledgers (WL)
*   Customer Experience (CX)
*   Core Infrastructure (CI)

**Schedules:**
*   4x 24/7 Schedules (one per team), with YOU on call.

**Services:**
*   **Business Services:** Payments API, Digital Wallet, etc.
*   **Technical Services:** API Gateway, Ledger DB, Service Mesh, etc.
*   **Dependencies:** Full topology mapping (L1/L2/L3).

**Automation:**
*   Global Event Orchestration (Routing & Severity rules).
*   Team Event Orchestrations.

## 🧹 Tear Down

To destroy a specific POV environment, run the script with the `--destroy` flag:

```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh --destroy
```

Follow the prompts to select the Customer Name (workspace) you wish to remove. The script will:
1.  Verify credentials.
2.  Select the workspace (e.g., `pov-acme`).
3.  Run `terraform destroy`.
4.  Delete the workspace.
